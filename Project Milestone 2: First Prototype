1. What is the GitHub URL for your branch's commits?  

https://github.com/jstefanski1/CS498-Valvoline

2. Which user stories did your team implement?  Include the text of those user stories here (but you do not need to include any associated graphics).

Research Potential Improvements:
As Head of Engineering, I want to explore future advancements in vision systems for defect detection so that I can propose innovative solutions to enhance quality 
of the products at Valvoline.

Live Defect Detection:
As a Quality Control Engineer, I want to leverage vision systems for real-time defect detection so that I can reduce human error and improve the overall efficiency 
of the manufacturing process.


3. What problems did your team encounter during implementation?  How did you solve these?

Valvoline wants to study the success of vision systems in other industries; however, most of the details involed in these systems are private information and 
unavailable to us.


4. Is there any missing functionality for those user stories?  If so, how does your team plan to address it?

We are missing specific information about what hardware Valvoline should be using to optimize performance of their vision system. We plan to address it by researching
server architecture used in the best performing systems.

5. How did each team member contribute to this milestone?

  - Nishan Budhathoki:  I was able to research into the Technology Analysis side of our project especially into the topic of traditional image processing such 
as thresholding techniques, edge detection and color analysis. Trying to figure out which techniques would work the best for Valvoline's Vision system for quality 
control

  - Noble:

  - Prahar:  Formulated research on Current State-of-the-art technologies such as Deep Learning-based Vision Systems, smart cameras advanced lighting techniques 
and some Comparative Studies of Vision Systems across different industries like automotive industry

  - Milin:  For this prototype, I looked into the cost considerations of vision systems in the manufacturing industry. I found research papers that talked about 
the cost of collecting data for deep learning models and training them. Additionally, I did some research into the physical components of the systems and the cost 
for cameras, sensors, lighting, etc...

  - Jon Hall:  

  - Jonathan Stefanski:  Formulated research on challenges and limitations of latency on vision systems. This included researching a newer proactive continuous 
vision system model that has shown to reduce latency by 92%. I also researched edge computing and how this is beneficial and necessary for modern vision systems 
to decrease latency in industry 4.0.
